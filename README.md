# Graduation Projects Platform

We created a platform for archiving graduation projects, along with other functionalities that benefit the student and makes the journey seamless.

## How to run the project

- run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
- Make sure to provide all the environment variables needed to build the project which can be found in the `env.md` file (Ignore if these files are already present)
- run `npm run start` to start the back-end server and API
- run `ng serve --open` to compile and open the front-end in your browser

Note: When deploying the project, make sure to run `npm run build` and provide the folders in the `dist` folder to the deployment service.

Note: We do know that providing environment variables in the github repository is advised against, however the circumstances force us to do so.

## Environment Variables

Environment variables can be accessed [here](https://github.com/SaudC21/Graduation-Projects-Platform/blob/main/env.md)

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the Jasmine unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
